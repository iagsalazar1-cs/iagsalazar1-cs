### Project Repositories
This section provides a categorized overview of my hands-on projects and labs. Each repository is a deep dive into a specific area of focus. Each project includes documentation, currently being formalized into detailed markdown write-ups for easy access and review.

[**Cybersecurity Incident Response**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response)

A dedicated repository for threat analysis and security monitoring. This includes documentation of my IR Certification Executive Summaries and hands-on projects using Splunk for dashboard creation, Wazuh for deployment and log management, and Wireshark for network attack investigation.

**IR Certification Case Studies (CTF Challenges)**

- **One of Us:** I used a custom Python script to automate the scanning of suspicious files to extract a malicious hash.

- **Pigs Rules:** I developed a custom Snort IDS rule to detect and alert on malicious network activity.

- **Imperial Memory:** I analyzed a memory dump and a 7-Zip archive to uncover a hidden secret.

- **Mail n' Trail:** I analyzed Splunk logs to investigate suspicious honeypot activity and uncover the source of malicious downloads.

**Hands-On Labs**

- **Splunk Dashboard and Alert Creation:** This project involved customizing Splunk dashboards for HTTP 404 error visualization and configuring real-time alerts.

- **Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox - FIM, Custom Rules, and Active Response:** This project set up a Wazuh SIEM in VirtualBox, covering FIM, custom threat detection, and automated active response.

- **Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox - Windows 10 Agent & Log Management:** This project set up a Wazuh agent on a Windows 10 VM, covering FIM, custom rules, and active responses, along with log retention policies.

- **Network Attack Investigation in Wireshark:** This project involved analyzing network traffic captured in `.pcap` files using Wireshark to investigate simulated network attacks.


[**Network Administration & Labs**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs)

This repository details my hands-on experience in network administration, including Cisco switch/router configuration, VLANs for segmentation, and firewall management with pfSense and Suricata. Through practical projects, this collection showcases my ability to effectively set up, secure, troubleshoot, and optimize network infrastructures for robust connectivity. 

- **Essential Switch Configuration:** Configured basic network connectivity and security settings on a Cisco switch in Packet Tracer. 

- **Switch Port Security Configuration:** Implemented and tested port security policies on a Cisco switch to prevent unauthorized access.
 
- **Initial Router Configuration:** Performed fundamental setup and IP addressing for a Cisco router in a small Packet Tracer network.

- **Configuring Static Routes:** Manually configured IPv4 static routes on Cisco routers to establish inter-LAN and external network connectivity.

- **Configuring VLANs and Trunks:** Segmented networks using VLANs and trunking on Cisco switches for enhanced performance and security. 

- **Implementing Access Control Lists:** Applied standard and extended ACLs on Cisco routers to filter network traffic and control access.

- **Configuring Static, Dynamic, and Overload NAT:** Configured various NAT types on Cisco routers for IP address management and external communication.

- **PFSense Firewall Rule Configuration:** Managed firewall rules in pfSense to control network traffic, specifically ICMP, in a simulated environment.

- **Suricata Installation and Rule Configuration on PFSense:** Integrated and configured Suricata IDS/IPS on pfSense for advanced network threat monitoring and protection.

[**System Administration Projects**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/System-Administration-Projects/tree/main) **(Markdown Write-ups Coming Soon - Aug. 31th, 2025)**

This repository showcases my hands-on skills in managing and securing server environments. It features practical labs demonstrating my proficiency with Windows Server, Group Policy Objects (GPO), DNS/DHCP configuration. 

- **Windows Server Configuration:** This project focuses on the initial setup of a Windows Server domain and integrating a Windows client into it. **(In Progress...)**

- **Server Manager Group Policy Object Configuration:** This project highlights the essential use of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to manage and secure a Windows environment by disabling key features and customizing the desktop.

- **Configuring DNS and DHCP in Windows Server:** This project demonstrates the configuration of critical network services, including creating DNS records and setting up a DHCP server with a new IPv4 scope.

[**Cloud Solutions**](https://github.com/your-username/Cloud-Solutions) **(Projects Completed: Markdown Write-ups Coming Soon)**

A separate repository demonstrating my proficiency with modern cloud infrastructure, including documentation of EC2 instance deployments.

- EC2 Windows Server Instance Creation
